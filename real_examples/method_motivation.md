## Method Motivation

### Amount due - Pays every month and is on time. In middle of term

on bill item total financed cost
number of months in term

total / number of months = Amount due

### Amount due - pays every other month and is on time. In middle of term

on bill item total financed cost
number of months in term

how do we know this person pays every other month?

###Amount due - The person skipped a payment and pays every month. In middle of term

## Class Motivation

Is amount due going to be the same across all circumstances? E.g. is the formula for
calculating amount due for an on bill subscription the same as calculating amount due for a utility payment and wind plan?

If we wanted to bill a customer, how would we know how to reference these methods?

Is the total cost related to an on bill item or a subscription?

Could you have an amount due or balance for an item?

Why not just store everything on the subscription?
