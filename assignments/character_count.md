##Character Count

Given an array of colors, return a hash for each color with each character's character count. E.g.,
colors = ["purple", "yellow", "green", "red"]

green_hash = { "g": 1, "r": 1, "e": 2, "n": 1}
red_hash = { "r": 1, "e": 1, "d": 1}
purple_hash = { "p": 2, "e": 1, "u": 1, "l": 1, "r": 1}

## Notes

Remember, order doesn't matter in hashes.

## Additional Challenges

Have your program accept an argument of an array
Return the character with the highest count for each item
Return the character with the highest count overall
